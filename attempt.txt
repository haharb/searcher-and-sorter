Packet-switching: store-and-forward
▪ Transmission delay: takes L/R seconds to
transmit (push out) L-bit packet into link at R
bps
▪ Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at
router before it can be transmitted on next link
▪ End-end delay: 2L/R (above), assuming zero
propagation delay (more on delay shortly)

One-hop numerical example:
▪ L = 10 Kbits
▪ R = 100 Mbps
▪ one-hop transmission delay
= 0.1 msec
Packet-switching: queueing delay, loss
Packet queuing and loss: if arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds
transmission rate (bps) of link for a period of time:
▪ packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link
▪ packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills
up

Alternative to packet switching: circuit switching
end-end resources allocated to,
reserved for “call” between source
and destination
▪ in diagram, each link has four circuits.
• call gets 2nd circuit in top link and 1st
circuit in right link.
▪ dedicated resources: no sharing
• circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
▪ circuit segment idle if not used by call (no
sharing)
▪ commonly used in traditional telephone
networks

Frequency Division Multiplexing
(FDM)
▪ optical, electromagnetic frequencies
divided into (narrow) frequency
bands
▪ each call allocated its own band, can
transmit at max rate of that narrow
band
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
▪ time divided into slots
▪ each call allocated periodic slot(s), can
transmit at maximum rate of (wider)
frequency band, but only during its
time slot(s)
Packet switching versus circuit switching
Introduction: 1-28
Example:
▪ 1 Gb/s link
▪ each user:
• 100 Mb/s when “active”
• active 10% of time
packet switching allows more users to use network!
N
users 1 Gbps link
* Check out the online interactive exercises for more examples: http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive
▪ circuit-switching: 10 users Q: how did we get value 0.0004?
Q: what happens if > 35 users ?
▪ Packet-switching: with 35 users,
probability > 10 active at same time
is less than .0004 *
how did we get value 0.0004?
Introduction: 1-29
Probability Mass Function
Probability of getting exactly k successes in n trials
Packet switching versus circuit switching
Introduction: 1-30
▪ great for “bursty” data – sometimes has data to send, but at other times not
• resource sharing
• simpler, no call setup
▪ excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow
• protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
▪ Q: How to provide circuit-like behavior?
• bandwidth guarantees traditionally used for audio/video applications
Is packet switching a “slam dunk winner”?
Q: human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching)
versus on-demand allocation (packet switching)?
Internet structure: a “network of networks”
▪ Hosts connect to Internet via access Internet Service
Providers (ISPs)
• residential, enterprise (company, university, commercial) ISPs
▪ Access ISPs in turn must be interconnected
• so that any two hosts can send packets to each other
▪ Resulting network of networks is very complex
• evolution was driven by economics and national policies
▪ Let’s take a stepwise approach to describe current

Packet queueing delay (revisited)
Introduction: 1-46

▪ L: packet length (bits)
▪ a: average packet arrival rate
▪ La/R ~ 0: avg. queueing delay small
▪ La/R -> 1: avg. queueing delay large
▪ La/R > 1: more “work” arriving is
more than can be serviced - average
delay infinite!
La/R ~ 0

destination. For all i:
3 probes
3 probes
3 probes
• sends three packets that will reach router i on path towards
destination (with time-to-live field value of i)
• router i will return packets to sender
• sender measures time interval between transmission and reply

Protocol “layers” and reference models
Introduction: 1-53
Networks are complex,
with many “pieces”:
▪ hosts
▪ routers
▪ links of various media
▪ applications
▪ protocols
▪ hardware, software
Question:
is there any hope of
organizing structure of
network?
…. or at least our
discussion of networks?
Example: organization of air travel
Introduction: 1-54
airline travel: a series of steps, involving many services

layers: each layer implements a service
▪ via its own internal-layer actions
▪ relying on services provided by layer below
Q: describe in words
the service provided
in each layer above
Why layering?
Introduction: 1-56
dealing with complex systems:
▪ explicit structure allows identification, relationship of
complex system’s pieces
• layered reference model for discussion
▪ modularization eases maintenance, updating of system
• change in layer's service implementation: transparent to rest of
system
• e.g., change in gate procedure doesn’t affect rest of system
▪ layering considered harmful?
▪ layering in other complex systems?

Internet history
Introduction: 1-60
▪ 1970: ALOHAnet satellite network
in Hawaii
▪ 1974: Cerf and Kahn - architecture
for interconnecting networks
▪ 1976: Ethernet at Xerox PARC
▪ late70’s: proprietary architectures:
DECnet, SNA, XNA
▪ late 70’s: switching fixed length
packets (ATM precursor)
▪ 1979: ARPAnet has 200 nodes
1972-1980: Internetworking, new and proprietary nets
Cerf and Kahn’s internetworking
principles:
▪ minimalism, autonomy - no
internal changes required to
interconnect networks
▪ best-effort service model
▪ stateless routing
▪ decentralized control
define today’s Internet architecture
Internet history
Introduction: 1-61
▪ 1983: deployment of TCP/IP
▪ 1982: smtp e-mail protocol
defined
▪ 1983: DNS defined for nameto-IP-address translation
▪ 1985: ftp protocol defined
▪ 1988: TCP congestion control
▪ new national networks: CSnet,
BITnet, NSFnet, Minitel
▪ 100,000 hosts connected to
confederation of networks
1980-1990: new protocols, a proliferation of networks
Internet history
Introduction: 1-62
▪ early 1990s: ARPAnet
decommissioned
▪ 1991: NSF lifts restrictions on
commercial use of NSFnet
(decommissioned, 1995)
▪ early 1990s: Web
• hypertext [Bush 1945, Nelson 1960’s]
• HTML, HTTP: Berners-Lee
• 1994: Mosaic, later Netscape
• late 1990s: commercialization of the
Web
late 1990s – 2000s:
▪ more killer apps: instant
messaging, P2P file sharing
▪ network security to forefront
▪ est. 50 million host, 100 million+
users
▪ backbone links running at Gbps
1990, 2000s: commercialization, the Web, new applications
Internet history
Introduction: 1-63
▪ ~18B devices attached to Internet (2017)
• rise of smartphones (iPhone: 2007)
▪ aggressive deployment of broadband access
▪ increasing ubiquity of high-speed wireless access: 4G/5G, WiFi
▪ emergence of online social networks:
• Facebook: ~ 2.5 billion users
▪ service providers (Google, FB, Microsoft) create their own networks
• bypass commercial Internet to connect “close” to end user, providing
“instantaneous” access to search, video content, …
▪ enterprises run their services in “cloud” (e.g., Amazon Web Services,
Microsoft Azure)
